            In terms of picture conception, Michael Clayton, who is also the original work and screenwriter, also began
            to participate in the creation of the storyboard, and worked with the art director Rick Carter to recreate
            the dinosaur world!
            <br><br>
            However, the original work was full of a large number of dinosaur species, and the first thing the crew had
            to deal with was to reduce 15 species to 6. After that, it is necessary to carry out crazy data collection
            to show the 100% true face of the dinosaurs. After the co-superviser Lata Ryan joined, the main force
            gathered the post-special effects force and was responsible for using the computer drawing technology that
            was new at that time to draw the dinosaurs and put them on the film.
            <br><br>
            Later, through meetings with different visual effects companies, director Spielberg found that the original
            use of the most traditional film real-life shooting, with amazing computer drawing technology, the effect
            was the most frerrening. Finally, the special effects of the film are called "Dream Group" in the industry.
            The members include the late Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Dennis Mure from Industrial Light and Magic
            (ILM). N, and Michael Lantieri, who worked with Spielberg on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

        </div>
        <p id="content2">
            The 6-meter-high Tyrannosaurus Rex is made of glass fiber and nearly 1,500 kilograms of clay. The outer skin
            is elastic latex. The painter paints the skin with a large amount of pigments. The interior is mechanically
            operated by hydraulic technology for military purposes. The platform of Tyrannosaurus Rex and Tyrannosaurus
            Rex itself also have computer boards for remote control.
            <br><br>
            In addition, there are also other volumes of mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex to match different scenes and
            shots for puppet shooting. One of the small ones called "Waldo" is responsible for the rehearsal, allowing
            the computer to record its movements, and then complete the final action with a one-to-one version with a
            height of 6 meters, just like shooting a live-action movie!
            <br><br>
            For Jurassic Park, Stan Winston Studio hired a total of 60 painters, mechanical engineers and puppeteers. In
            addition to Tyrannosaurus Rex, the mechanical models also include the 1.8-meter-high Athlon, the Long-necked
            Brachiosaurus, the sick Triceratops, the Chicken Crown Dragon, the Double Ridge Dragon and the Speed Dragon
            Baby, all of which play important roles in the movie!

            The depth of field adjustment team used the well-known software VDX of Stereo D. If necessary, the VFX
            personnel in the team will make 3D enhancement effects for the objects in the picture, such as smoke, fire,
            rain, etc. Finally, the painter's team will make final modifications for each shot, or fill in the
            information that is still missing. The rain or leaves in the play have become a crucial part of the "3D
            transformation" production. This time, the team can be said to face a major test! This film has become the
            most "raindrop" in the history of 3D conversion movies! To put it to put it on the side, it's all to make
            people more like being in a park. In addition, this "3D conversion production" team also increased the
            proportion of dinosaurs 20 years ago, further making people feel that they are so close.
            <br><br>
            Compared with 20 years ago, Tyrannosaurus in Jurassic Park 3D is undoubtedly more reminiscent of the
            personal fear of the attack of Tyrannosaurus Rex. The roar of Tyrannosaurus from the elephant baby was
            re-edited and stitched by the sound engineer, which was almost completely equivalent to the roaring of real
            dinosaurs. The audience sat in the cinema and felt it back and forth. Surrounded by the roar of
            Tyrannosaurus Rex, it is right in front of you...!
